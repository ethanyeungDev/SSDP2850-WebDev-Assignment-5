- Copilot - attempted to have it install vite and sass for me. It erred enough that it wasn't worth the bother and I opted to revert the commits.

- Copilot - To start off, I gave the following prompt to readily convert the existing tailwind styles. "I will not link scss directly in index. Instead, index will be linked to main.js, which with vite will call all the scss styles I need. I want you to translated the styles/componetns css files into scss files so npm run dev will compile everything." I don't necessarily want everything as sass: a number of things will probably function better as runtime tailwind, especially aesthetically - but starting with the organizational backbone as Sass would be for the better.
