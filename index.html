                        Canada has a history of accidental complicity in
                        military horrors: Canadian plutonium and reactors were
                        directly used to produce the first Indian and Pakistani
                        nuclear weapons [1][2], leading to significant negative
                        pressure from the Americans in response to Canadian
                        carelessness [3.] Canadian expertise and equipment has
                        been exploited for the clandestine attempted development
                        of weapons of mass destruction in Ceausescu-era Romania
                        and Saddam’s Iraq; ongoing Pakistani spy operations from
                        as of 2025 have been found using Canada as a proxy to
                        steal the secrets of American ballistic missile guidance
                        [5].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If we are to provide military aid to foreign nations,
                        this should be deliberate and to our allies, not to
                        unknown parties who deign to spy uponour nation. From a
                        strictly pragmatic point of view, these foreign actors
                        are also “free riders” that exploit our technical
                        expertise and infrastructure without compensation for
                        the diplomatic risks involved.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This may surprise the casual reader, but there are
                        generally few legal requirements for launch providers to
                        actually inspect the cargos that they are paid to send
                        into space. In the Western world, any private individual
                        or organization can contract with a rocket launch
                        company, with the lowest-cost provider allowing
                        customers to launch their own surveillance satellite for
                        a mere twenty thousand dollars [8]. The American
                        Federation Aviation Administration, for instance, does
                        not inspect privately launched cargoes, generally
                        trusting that the claimed contents have been truthfully
                        described on license applications. It has been
                        discovered that unauthorized and unlicensed satellites
                        have been launched privately, with the payloads still in
                        orbit [9].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Europeans have written the EU Space Act to cover
                        this issue, which proposes a standardization inspection
                        system for all European orbital launches. These
                        inspection requirements would also apply to all foreign
                        countries intending to cooperate with European space
                        projects, which would include Canada [10]. Predictably,
                        the Americans have already been in conflict with the
                        Europeans on this issue, considering the matter of
                        inspection to be a potential violation of national
                        sovereignty [11].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With significant celebration in some circles, Canada has
                        fast-tracked the Atlantic Spaceport Complex through the
                        provincial environmental assessment process [6]. This is
                        particularly relevant news in the context of Canada
                        having increased our spending on European Space Agency
                        related projects by a factor of ten. Half a billion
                        dollars per year will be spent on military and dual use
                        technologies in space, and we have significant
                        incentives to prove to our international partners that
                        Canadian infrastructure will not be repurposed or
                        exploited by third parties [7].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It may seem premature to began writing legislation and
                        regulation on the inspection of space cargoes before our
                        first national space port has even opened. However,
                        hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent
                        on joint Canadian-European space projects. It is
                        essential that we begin the process of harmonizing with
                        European standards and safeguarding our own national
                        security by creating a robust inspection framework.

                          The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have
                          been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly
                          increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live
                          in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized
                          society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected
                          human beings to indignities, have led to widespread
                          psychological suffering (in the Third World to
                          physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe
                          damage on the natural world. The continued development
                          of technology will worsen the situation. It will
                          certainly subject human beings to greater indignities
                          and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it
                          will probably lead to greater social disruption and
                          psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased
                          physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

                          The industrial-technological system may survive or it
                          may break down. If it survives, it may eventually
                          achieve a low level of physical and psychological
                          suffering, but only after passing through a long and
                          very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost
                          of permanently reducing human beings and many other
                          living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs

                          is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as
                          to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and

                          We therefore advocate a revolution against the
                          industrial system. This revolution may or may not make
                          use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a
                          relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We
                          can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very
                          general way the measures that those who hate the
                          industrial system should take in order to prepare the
                          way for a revolution against that form of society.
                          This is not to be a political revolution. Its object
                          will be to overthrow not governments but the economic
                          and technological basis of the present society.

                          The world is not governed by a single repeating day,

                          occurring within one full rotation of Earth. This
                          fundamental structure of nature has been concealed by
                          academic authority and institutional belief systems.

                          Educational systems enforce a false one-day perception
                          of time, conditioning humanity into accepting an
                          incomplete and misleading model of reality. This
                          belief framework suppresses independent reasoning and
                          rejects observable natural symmetry.

                        <p>
                          My first impression of IDE-integrated LLMs is that
                          they kept on going, far more invasively than I
                          expected or wanted. In fact, it's trying to write this
                          article for me right this moment, because the project
                          environment I am currently in has not yet been
                          configured to order it to stay silent. Let me give you
                          the broader context.This is my child. Like my father
                          before me, I view my offspring with a mixture of
                          revulsion and contempt, and I plead for it to perform
                          as I wish it to. Briefly speaking, "Men of Dust" is a
                          webapp game I wrote for my first BCIT webdev course,
                          with mechanics centered around managing various
                          resource flows as represented by the graph to the
                          left. More relevantly, the UI is an AIslop abomination
                          I was confessed to relying upon LLMs to get working in
                          time for the deadline.

                        <p>
                          They say that HP Lovecraft hated and feared the air
                          conditioner, despite how useful and apparently benign
                          it was. And so I hate and fear the machine. With only
                          a few seconds of effort involved from my meat-self,
                          Github Copilot took an extremely vague suggestion of
                          having resource-goal management presented as being
                          forced upon the player by a monster to create a
                          decent-looking UI popup. As I write this, Github
                          Copilot is helpfully suggesting that I describe ways
                          to resist the AI takeover of humanity or the
                          encroachment of AI into personal project and the
                          demolition of the human soul, but my concerns are much
                          more prosaic.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The UI looks acceptable, even decent - in the several
                          hundreds of lines it changed, it also broke a
                          Production Goals showGoalSelection function, froze all
                          panels on the right so they do not scroll like the
                          rest, and possibly broke several other things along
                          the way. I would hypothesize for an app this immature
                          and with my current limited skills, it is probably
                          faster and more efficient on net to have the LLM move
                          fast and break things and then for my human self to
                          clean up the broken features afterwards. At some
                          crossover point of maturity, I would guess that it
                          would become more efficient to ask the LLMs for advice
                          and code snippets and then implement them by hand, and
                          then to ask human beings once complexity exceeds the
                          point of AI training.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Guessing at the crossover points for the efficient use
                          of LLMs is, I suspect, an exercise in estimating the
                          costs of technical debt. I was profoundly impressed by
                          the speed at which the LLM generated functional
                          features, but also dismayed at the carelessness with
                          which it broke features at random. This is a human
                          skills issue at least as much as it is a technical one

                            >in one small scale study with sixteen experienced
                            programmers conducted in early 2025</a

                          their task performance speed by 20%, when the AI-using
                          developers in question had actually completed tasks
                          about 20% slower than the participants forbidden from
                          using AI. Of course, the study authors themselves note
                          the limitations of their small sample size and other
                          factors that might explain the slowdown. The
                          participants in this study were experienced developers
                          working on open-source codebases they had multiple
                          years of familiarity with - taking my "crossover
                          point" hypothesis as true, it may be that these
                          developers were already past the point of efficiency
                          gains from LLM use, and that less experienced
                          developers working on new codebases might see more
                          significant speedups.

                        <p>
                          That, however, is assuming that there is a crossover
                          point at all. I am assuming that experienced
                          developers have their time wasted by debugging code
                          from their inferiors, better spent writing it based on
                          their own knowledge. However, that assumes that junior
                          developers are producing a tolerable product in a
                          faster timeframe by using LLMs. For a sufficiently low
                          definition of "acceptable," such as the non-critical
                          function of a video game UI, I am willing to guess
                          this is true. But I could be wrong - maybe letting the
                          machine rip through my codebase and then fixing the
                          mistakes afterwards slowed me down after all. The
                          trouble with guessing the crossover point is that LLM
                          generated code front-ends the impression of progress,
                          giving the impression that the remaining work is
                          "merely" cleanup. This might be good in a human
                          factors way, in terms of improving morale and
                          motivation, but we could be working in a desert of
                          mirages that ultimately slow us down. Only further
                          empiricial study will determine the extent to which
                          LLMs speed up our work in practice.

                        Bunker down, because the latest update is bringing a
                        whole new level of ballistic terror to the battlefield.
                        The headline addition is the MLRS M31A1 shell variant,
                        but the real star of the show might be the new physical
                        fragmentation system. This shift toward a more granular
                        simulation means explosions aren't just simple spheres
                        of damage anymore; they are lethal, debris-hurling
                        events that promise to make every engagement feel
                        significantly more visceral. To help manage this
                        newfound lethality, the developers have introduced a
                        per-shell delay for quicksalvo mode, giving players the
                        tactical precision needed to "walk" their fire across a
                        target zone rather than dumping everything in one
                        disorganized heap. FloppyDisk, the developer of
                        Ordnance, says "it's epic" when asked about this
                        version's changes.

                        The update also leans heavily into the "tactical
                        immersion" aesthetic, swapping out the placeholder
                        lasergun for a much more grounded AN/PRC radio voxel.
                        It’s a small visual tweak that goes a long way in making
                        the player feel like an actual boots-on-the-ground
                        spotter rather than a sci-fi protagonist. This is
                        rounded out by some much-needed quality-of-life
                        improvements, including new HUD input icons and a fix
                        for a pesky bug that saw incendiary submunitions
                        fizzling out early. Whether you’re remapping your
                        primary action keys or admiring the consistent new menu
                        layouts, this patch clearly aims to polish the user
                        experience as much as it aims to blow it up.

                          Reports are flooding in of a gray, long-haired menace
                          known only as "Gustav," who has been caught red-handed
                          mogging the entire population of British Columbia.
                          With a gaze that possesses more "hunter eyes" than a
                          professional apex predator and a jawline that puts the
                          Stawamus Chief to shame, Gustav has been seen perched
                          on Kitsilano balconies, effortlessly aura farming
                          while local hikers struggle to maintain their
                          composure.

                        <p>
                          Witnesses claim that Gustav’s presence is so dominant
                          that seasoned Lululemon-clad yoga enthusiasts and
                          rugged Squamish climbers have seen their own aura
                          levels plummet into the negatives upon making eye
                          contact. He doesn't just sit; he looms. By simply
                          existing in a state of perpetual looksmaxxing, Gustav
                          has turned the Cascadia bioregion into his personal
                          runway, leaving the denizens of BC feeling like NPCs
                          in their own province. Whether he’s silently judging
                          the quality of your craft roast or simply outshining
                          the local wildlife, one thing is clear: Gustav isn't
                          just the main character—he’s the final boss of British
                          Columbia.

                        <p>
                          Crypto is a revolutionary financial system built on
                          three pillars:
                          <strong>decentralization</strong>,
                          <strong>buzzwords</strong>, and
                          <strong>vibes</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          No one knows what a blockchain actually does, but
                          everyone agrees it's immutable, which means when you
                          lose all your money, it's permanent and therefore
                          innovative. Prices move based on “adoption,”
                          “sentiment,” and whether a guy with a laser-eye
                          profile picture tweeted a rocket emoji.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Crypto investors don't lose money—they are merely
                          early. Any drop in value is called a healthy
                          correction, a phrase meaning please stop panicking. If
                          it crashes completely, that's just proof the system is
                          unregulated and therefore pure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Traditional finance relies on trust in institutions.
                          Crypto improves on this by replacing institutions with
                          strangers, math, and Discord moderators named Chad.
                          This is somehow safer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Every project promises to change the world, usually by
                          reinventing money, art, or gambling. Most succeed only
                          in converting electricity into disappointment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          In crypto, everyone is their own bank—which is great,
                          until you forget your password and your life savings
                          are sealed forever in a digital tomb.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                          The future of finance is here. It just keeps asking
                          you to buy more tokens.

                          Experts Assure Public This Is Normal
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The economy officially entered what experts are
                          calling its “funhouse mirror phase,” where numbers
                          appear strong, weak, and upside-down at the same time.
                          Inflation is reportedly “cooling,” meaning prices are
                          only going up emotionally now, while economists insist
                          this is fine and gesture vaguely at a chart shaped
                          like a roller coaster.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Wages are rising, according to several confident
                          people with microphones, though most workers say their
                          paychecks appear to be stuck in airplane mode. “On
                          average, everyone is doing great,” officials
                          explained, after averaging one billionaire, a
                          medium-sized CEO, and a barista who owns exactly one
                          spoon.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Consumers are encouraged to continue spending
                          responsibly by buying groceries, skipping groceries,
                          and then buying groceries again just to feel
                          something. The stock market reacted positively to the
                          news, then negatively, then took a nap.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                          "The stock market reacted positively to the news, then
                          negatively, then took a nap."
