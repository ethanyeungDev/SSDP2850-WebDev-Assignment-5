Frankly speaking I don't like sass. I use tailwind as much as I can because it makes sense to me and I find it readable. I don't really *need* SASS for anything here - nothing is complex enough to really justify it.

Given that I had to use SASS, however, I used it to define color variables and the background cards, because that is a purpose for which reusing mixin components mightbe conceivably useful.
